# fNIRS setup


> [!NOTE] Note on the fNIRS setup
> We're currently recovering from some data loss.


These are some config files found on the computer, where the [[NIRScout]] device was setup.

They seem to contain hardware configurations.

Default experimental layout is included in `channel_masking`, and it seems important.

There seems to be no [[Zebris]] montage file. This contains the 3D positions of the [optodes][NIRScout#^a8ea9f] (or channels, not sure). It is useful for analysis with [[MNE]].

Installation files are ordered in fNIRS computer.

## Calibration

## Default layout

![NIRS/Montages/Default_16x22/Standard.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WriessneggerLab/Protocols/main/NIRS/Montages/Default_16x22/Standard.png)

A default layout was created based on Wriessnegger 2018[^1]. Legacy files (`channel_masking/whole_head.hwc` and `channel_masking/TopoLayout_wholehead.tpl`) contained the masking and layout data: 16 sources and 22 detectors. A [[NIRStar]] configuration has been created to reproduce this setup with minimal setup. The folder including all files in usder `Montages/Default_16x22`.

Diagnostics executed on 2022-05-02. All tests passed.

Possible issues: Assumed equidistant optical distances:
```
Opt_Distance = "30	30	30	30	30	30	30	30	30	30	30	30	30	30	30	30	30	30	30	30	30	30	30	30	30	30	30	30	30	30	30	30	30	30	30	30	30	30	30	30	30	30	30	30	30	30	30	30	30	30	30	30	30	30	30	30	30	30	30	30	30\0D\0A"
```
