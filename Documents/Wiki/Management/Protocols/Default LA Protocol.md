The following diagrams and checklists can help you setup your experiment consistently. If you have any observation or suggestion please open an issue or make a PR.

### Preparation
- [ ] Print your EEG [[layout]]
- [ ] Charge batteries: either [[LiveAmp]] via USB or power bank.
- [ ] Make sure the [[LA electrodes]] are available and clean.
- [ ] Check you have the [[Consumables]] you need:
	- [ ] Conductive gel and syringes
	- [ ] Alcohol and cotton swabs
	- [ ] EOG stickers
	- [ ] ECG stickers
	- [ ] Paper towels (to clean up extra gel)
	- [ ] Masks and latex gloves if needed.
- [ ] Measure your participant's head. We have three [[cap sizes]]: 54, 56, 58
- [ ] Prepare the adequate cap with the electrodes.
- [ ] Check the two necessary USBs are available: [[HASP Key]] for software and [[Bluetooth Dongle]] for connectivity.

Optional Ext:
- [ ] Prepare your external electrodes: [[ECG]], [[GSR]], etc.
- [ ] Make sure the [[Power Bank]] is charged.

### Measurement

- [ ] Place the cap:
  1. Measure the distance from Nasion to Inion. Cz should be in the middle.
  2. Measure the distance from ear to ear. Cz should be in the middle.
  3. Look at the participant from the front. Does it look symmetric?
  4. Connect the Amplifier and turn it on.
- [ ] Start the software:
	- [[BrainVision Recorder]] (Requires [[HASP Key]]): This software reads data from the [[LiveAmp]]. In preferences, RemoteDataAccess should be enabled. Make sure your layout is set correctly in the workspace.
	- [[BrainVisionRDA]]: This sends data from BVRecorder through an LSL stream.
	- [[LSLRecorder]]: Records LSL streams into XDF format.
	- Your Paradigm: the experiment you prepared for presenting stimuli and instructions to your participants.
- [ ] Place gel in electrodes. With the impedance view open in BVRecorder, use the syringes to place a bit of gel in the cap. Correct until impedance levels on BVRecorder are lower than your selected threshold. Start placing gel in ground [[GND]] and reference [[REF]] electrodes.
- [ ] Check the signals at 20 uV. Do they look like normal [[EEG]]? is there noise from the power line? Is there muscle noise?
- [ ] Ask your participant to produce artefacts: teeth clenching, blinking, moving eyes, swallowing.
- [ ] Leave the signals visible on [[BrainVision RDA|BVRecorder]] (otherwise [[BrainVision RDA|BVRDA]] won't send data)
- [ ] (optional [[EXG]]): Setup your external electrodes.
- [ ] Link [[BVRDA]]
- [ ] Start your [[protocol]].
- [ ] Verify all your streams appear in [[LSL LabRecorder]].
- [ ] Check any [[experiment requirements]].
- [ ] Start recording.


### Clean up
- [ ] Remove cap and ensure your participant has all they need to clean their hair.
- [ ] Take material upstairs to the sink:
	- Syringes and needles
	- Cap and electrodes
- [ ] Separate cap and electrodes.
- [ ] [[Disinfect]] cap.
- [ ] Wash electrodes with water and a toothbrush.
- [ ] Wash syringes and needles with water.
- [ ] Wash off disinfectant from cap, and dry with a towel.
- [ ] Bring everything back to the fNIRS/VR lab.
