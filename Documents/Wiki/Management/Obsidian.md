If you like the idea try importing your [[Zotero]] bibliographic references with the [obsidian-citation-plugin](https://github.com/hans/obsidian-citation-plugin), and creating a markdown bibliographic note. You can then visualize them in a [timeline](https://github.com/Darakah/obsidian-timelines), or of course as a [graph](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Graph+view).
