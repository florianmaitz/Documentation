To concistently interact with your participants during an experiment, you will generally program a Paradigm: a sequence of stimuli (like an image presentation, or a sound) and responses (pressing a mouse key, typing, or moving a controler) in a specific sequence (randomized, block-randomized, sequential). We suggest the usage of [[Psychopy]] for the design of your paradigms. Take a look at our templates:
