# Lab Documentation
Reference and documentation Lab usage.

> [!WARNING] Warning 
> This documentation is currently being updated to a knowledge base. We recommend the usage of [[Obsidian]] to read it.

With this repository we aim to standarize default procedures across experiments, promote adequate usage of the lab devices and resources.

## Lab Rules
A google calendar is used for coordinating measurements. Please contact Prof. Wriessnegger for access. To reserve the lab create an event on the calendar with the study name and your name in parethesis. Please only reserve the timeslots that you will definitely use, and mark cancelled events as such, or remove the event from the calendar. Don't write sensitive data on the calendar. Students may not measure if the staff is not available to supervise them. Measurement hours are 8 to 18 hrs. Please leave the lab clean and every device as you found it. Don't install [[Software]] on the lab computers. Students must fill the `INE Liablility Declaration`. You can find this form under the `Documents` folder

## Measurements
For every measurement please make sure you're collecting participant's [[Informed Consent]], and write a [[Measurement Report]], and log your measurement on the [[Logbook]].
We highly encourage you to have a measurement protocol. This can be a checklist with every step of your procedure. An example is provided under the `LiveAmp` folder.
If [[Consumables]] are running low (gel, towels, ECG stickers) inform the lab responsable with time, so they may provide them for the next measurements.
Place a sign at the door to avoid unexpected interruptions. A printed sign is provided next to the lab entrance. As long as the sign is present, it must be respected. This also means complete silence.
Do not leave participants alone in the lab for more than 5 minutes.
Clean the devices according to their specified recommendations.
When you finish your measurement, you are responsible to ensure the necessary devices and consumables are available for the next measurement. This also applies for device's battery charge.
Used [[Towels]] must be left in the [[4th floor Lab]] bathroom. If the bin is full, bring it to the INE.
Back up the recorded data on the Institute's servers.
Do not keep sensitive data on the cloud. If you must, only do so on services with two-factor-authentication activated.
